###  Podcast: Education in the COVID-19 Crisis  
**Role:** Co-producer  
**Organization:** Oxford Policy Management (OPM)  
**Location:** Pakistan  
**Year:** 2020

This podcast explored how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted children, teachers, and non-state schools in Pakistan, particularly low-fee private and non-formal models. I co-produced the episode and co-authored a blog that reflected on the risks of permanent school closures and the need for more resilient education systems. The work contributed to ongoing discussions on crisis-responsive education policy.
