I have worked in the development industry for over 5 years as a consultant with Oxford Policy Management, Monitoring and Evaluation Manager at Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and Data and Research Scientist at Girl Rising. 

Over these years, I led, and supported projects that spanned multiple countries across the Global South, including Pakistan, Kenya, and other areas in Africa and Asia, focusing specifically on social protection, education, and health. In these roles, I employed a range of rigorous research methods. I designed and implemented large-scale household surveys, conducted in-depth qualitative fieldwork, managed mixed-methods evaluations, and ensured ethical and context-sensitive data practices. My work combined statistical analysis with grounded, participatory approaches to generate actionable insights for program design, delivery, and evaluation. 

###  Informal Entrepreneurship among South Asian Women in East London  
**Role:** Independent Researcher  
**Organization:** London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)  
**Location:** United Kingdom  
**Years:** 2017–2018

This qualitative study examined why South Asian women turn to informal work in East London. In-depth interviews revealed how discrimination, skills mismatch, and limited childcare support restrict access to formal employment. Many women instead pursued opportunities in the informal economy—especially through ethnic products and services—highlighting institutional incongruence and adaptive economic strategies.

I led this research from start to finish. It was awarded a distinction and published as a book chapter in *Informal Ethnic Entrepreneurship* (Springer, 2018).

**Role:** Co-author and Data Analyst  
**Organization:** Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)  
**Location:** Pakistan  
**Years:** 2022–2023

This rapid mixed-methods study explored barriers faced by women in accessing reproductive health services after the 2022 floods. I led data analysis and co-authored the article published in *BioMed Research International*. The study underscored the need for more integrated disaster response mechanisms and gender-sensitive service delivery.

###  Impact Evaluation of Mwangaza Mashinani (Kenya)  
**Role:** Quantitative Researcher Midline and Endline Evaluation 
**Organization:** Oxford Policy Management (OPM) & UNICEF  
**Location:** Kenya  
**Years:** 2019–2021

This pilot project provided solar energy devices to vulnerable, off-grid communities in Kilifi and Garissa counties. I led the quantitative components of the midline and endline evaluations, including survey instrument design, enumerator training, and data collection from over 2,000 households. Findings—shared through an interactive dashboard at a UNICEF conference—highlighted improvements in educational outcomes, though health and livelihood impacts were more modest. The results shaped program adjustments and informed decisions to scale the initiative in other regions.

###  Performance Evaluation of Pakistan’s Lady Health Workers Programme  
**Role:** Qualitative Researcher  
**Organization:** Oxford Policy Management (OPM) & UNICEF  
**Location:** Pakistan  
**Years:** 2019–2020

This national evaluation examined the viability of Pakistan’s Lady Health Workers Programme following devolution. I led the qualitative research across all provinces, conducting focus group discussions and stakeholder interviews with senior government officials. I also managed data analysis and co-authored the final evaluation report. The findings, presented at a national policy workshop, highlighted mixed outcomes in health indicators and implementation challenges, but reinforced the program’s value in expanding maternal and child healthcare.

This podcast explored how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted children, teachers, and non-state schools in Pakistan, particularly low-fee private and non-formal models.
