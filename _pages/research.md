I have worked in the development industry for over 5 years as a consultant with Oxford Policy Management, Monitoring and Evaluation Manager at the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), and Data and Research Scientist at Girl Rising.

Over these years, I led and supported projects that spanned multiple countries across the Global South, including Pakistan, Kenya, and other areas in Africa and Asia, focusing specifically on social protection, education, and health. In these roles, I employed a range of rigorous research methods. I designed and implemented large-scale household surveys, conducted in-depth qualitative fieldwork, managed mixed-methods evaluations, and ensured ethical and context-sensitive data practices. My work combined statistical analysis with grounded, participatory approaches to generate actionable insights for program design, delivery, and evaluation.
