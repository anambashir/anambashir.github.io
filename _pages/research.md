This page presents applied research and evaluation projects I contributed to as a consultant with Oxford Policy Management and in collaboration with development partners such as the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), UNICEF, and others. These projects spanned multiple countries across the Global South, including Pakistan and Kenya, and focused on core areas of social policy such as social protection, education, health, and gender equity.

In these roles, I employed a range of rigorous research methods. I designed and implemented large-scale household surveys, conducted in-depth qualitative fieldwork, managed mixed-methods evaluations, and ensured ethical and context-sensitive data practices. My work combined statistical analysis with grounded, participatory approaches to generate actionable insights for program design, delivery, and evaluation. 

### Research Projects

#### üìò Informal Entrepreneurship among South Asian Women in East London  
**Role:** Independent researcher | **Institution:** London School of Economics  
*2017‚Äì2018*

This qualitative study examined why South Asian women turn to informal work in East London. In-depth interviews revealed how discrimination, skills mismatch, and limited childcare support restrict access to formal employment. Many women instead pursued opportunities in the informal economy‚Äîespecially through ethnic products and services‚Äîhighlighting institutional incongruence and adaptive economic strategies.

I led this research from start to finish, including design, fieldwork, analysis, and writing. It was awarded a distinction and published as a book chapter in *Informal Ethnic Entrepreneurship* (Springer, 2018).

#### üîã Impact Evaluation of Mwangaza Mashinani (Kenya)  
**Role:** Quantitative lead | **Institution:** UNICEF & Local Partner Orgs  
*2019‚Äì2021*  
This pilot provided solar energy to vulnerable communities in Kilifi and Garissa counties. I led quantitative components of the midline and endline evaluations‚Äîdesigning survey instruments, training enumerators, and overseeing data collection from 2,000+ households. Findings showed marked educational gains, modest livelihood outcomes, and were shared via an interactive dashboard at a UNICEF conference. The results influenced scaling decisions and program adjustments.

This national evaluation assessed a community health programme‚Äôs post-devolution implementation. I conducted and led qualitative research (FGDs, stakeholder interviews) across provinces, analyzed the data, and co-authored the final report. The findings‚Äîhighlighting maternal health successes and system-wide constraints‚Äîwere presented at a national policy workshop and contributed to the programme‚Äôs continuation.
